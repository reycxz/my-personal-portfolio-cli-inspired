# Blog Linking Guide - Connect Your Content

This guide demonstrates how to use the powerful blog linking system to create connections between your posts and enhance reader navigation.

## Why Link Your Blogs?

Connecting related content helps readers:

- Discover more relevant information
- Navigate your knowledge base efficiently
- Understand concepts that build upon each other
- Stay engaged with your content longer

## Linking Methods

### 1. Automatic Blog References

The simplest way to reference another blog post:

```markdown
{{blog:react-typescript-guide}}
```

This automatically creates a link using the target blog's title.

### 2. Custom Link Text

For more control over the link text:

```markdown
{{blog:linux_commands|Essential Linux Commands Every Developer Should Know}}
```

### 3. Manual Links

You can also create traditional markdown links:

```markdown
[Check out my React TypeScript guide](/blogs/react-typescript-guide)
```

## Related Posts Feature

The system automatically suggests related posts based on:

- Common keywords in titles
- Similar descriptions
- Shared categories or tags

For example, this post about documentation would be related to other guides and tutorials.

## Navigation Enhancement

Each blog post includes:

- **Previous/Next Navigation**: Chronological blog browsing
- **Related Posts**: Content-based recommendations
- **Table of Contents**: Easy in-page navigation for longer posts

## Best Practices

### 1. Strategic Linking

- Link to foundational concepts early in posts
- Reference advanced topics for readers wanting to go deeper
- Create learning paths through your content

### 2. Context-Aware Links

Instead of generic "click here" links, use descriptive text:

- ❌ "For more info, {{blog:react-guide|click here}}"
- ✅ "Learn more about {{blog:react-typescript-guide|React with TypeScript best practices}}"

### 3. Create Content Clusters

Group related posts by themes:

- Programming tutorials
- Tool reviews and guides
- Project showcases
- Learning resources

## Example Usage

Here's how you might reference other content in your blogs:

```markdown
Before diving into advanced React patterns, make sure you're comfortable with 
{{blog:react-typescript-guide|React and TypeScript fundamentals}}.

For setting up your development environment, check out my 
{{blog:linux_commands|Linux commands guide}}.
```

## Implementation Details

The linking system:

- Processes `{{blog:filename}}` references automatically
- Supports custom link text with the `|` separator
- Falls back gracefully if referenced blogs don't exist
- Works with both `.md` extensions and clean filenames

## Adding Images to Your Blog Posts

You can include images in your blog posts using standard Markdown syntax or HTML. Images should be placed in a directory with the same name as your blog post (without the `.md` extension).

### Directory Structure

For a blog post named `blog-linking-guide.md`, create a directory `blog-linking-guide/` in the `public/images/` folder and place your images there:

```text
public/blogs/
├── blog-linking-guide.md
public/images/
├── blog-linking-guide/
│   ├── sample-image.svg
│   └── other-image.png
```

### Using Images in Markdown

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/sample-image.svg)
```

This will automatically resolve to the correct path: `/images/blog-linking-guide/sample-image.svg`

### Example Image

Here's a sample image included in this blog post:

![Sample Blog Image](/images/sample-image.svg)

### Using HTML for More Control

You can also use HTML img tags for more control:

```html
<img src="sample-image.svg" alt="Sample" width="200" height="150" />
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned features include:

- Category-based filtering
- Tag-based recommendations
- Search functionality
- Comment system integration
- Image optimization and lazy loading
