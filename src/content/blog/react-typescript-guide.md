# Getting Started with React and TypeScript

React and TypeScript make a powerful combination for building robust web applications. TypeScript adds static type checking to JavaScript, helping catch errors early and improving code quality.

## Why Use TypeScript with React?

1. **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation
2. **Early Error Detection**: Catch type-related errors at compile time
3. **Improved Code Documentation**: Types serve as documentation
4. **Better Refactoring**: Safe renaming and restructuring of code

## Setting Up a New Project

To create a new React project with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Basic Component with TypeScript

Here's a simple example of a React component with TypeScript:

```tsx
interface GreetingProps {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}

const Greeting: React.FC<GreetingProps> = ({ name, age }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      {age && <p>You are {age} years old.</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Greeting;
```

## Benefits in Practice

TypeScript helps prevent common React mistakes:

- **Props validation**: Ensures components receive the right props
- **State typing**: Prevents incorrect state updates
- **Event handling**: Proper typing for event handlers
- **Ref handling**: Type-safe refs to DOM elements

## Conclusion

While there's a learning curve, TypeScript significantly improves the React development experience, especially for larger applications. The upfront investment in learning TypeScript pays off with better code quality and fewer runtime errors.
